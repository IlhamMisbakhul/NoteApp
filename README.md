# This is NoteApp Basic

## Flutter Basic Note App
This is a simple Note Application using Flutter framework. This project is really good starting point if you wanted to create your own Note App because it already had the UI (of course it has), and any other functionality such as navigating to different pages, and saving your note. You can clone this project if you are interested. FYI, this project was not using any databases, so you could save your note, but it will disappear once you close your app. However it's a good start for you to develop your own Note App.
